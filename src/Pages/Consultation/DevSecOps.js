              The DevOps age has been transformative. Virtual machines may be easily spun up and workloads deployed in a seamless manner. However, there is one aspect of security that many businesses overlook. It is critical to incorporate security into the delivery pipeline as early as possible. This is where DevSecOps comes into play.
              </p>
              <p>
              The concept of incorporating security measures into the DevOps process is known as DevSecOps, or 'Security as Code.' The purpose of employing DevSecOps services is to close gaps between IT and security while guaranteeing that code is delivered safely and quickly.   </p>

            <p>DevOps is a term that refers to a set of methods and tools that help software engineers and infrastructure teams collaborate more effectively. These, in turn, automate the delivery of applications and services across businesses in a timely and dependable manner. Automated provisioning, continuous integration, continuous monitoring, and test-driven development are all areas of concentration in DevOps.</p>  
            <p>DevSecOps integrates security controls and processes into the DevOps workflow and automates the fundamental security duties as an extension of the DevOps philosophy. These security concepts are introduced early in the development phase and applied throughout the life cycle of the project. DevSecOps incorporates application development knowledge and procedures into security teams enabling efficient communication across the teams, in addition to giving security knowledge and practises to DevOps teams</p>
