          <p>The cloud is critical for digital transformation. Businesses use the cloud to quickly launch new digital products and services, upgrade IT environments, and support hybrid working. As a result, cloud adoption has surpassed all expectations and continues to rise. Cloud solutions are being used by businesses as their business innovation needs to outstrip the capabilities of on-premises settings. Migrating to the cloud, on the other hand, poses additional cybersecurity challenges. As you migrate to hybrid cloud systems, you must maintain visibility, control, and security. To keep ahead of sophisticated threats, you'll need security management at each important stage of your cloud transformation journey.</p>

              <p>The discipline and practice of protecting cloud computing environments, applications, data, and information is known as cloud security, or cloud computing security. Defending cloud environments against unauthorized use/access, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, hackers, malware, and other threats is what cloud security is all about. While cloud security refers to security for cloud environments, cloud-based security refers to security services delivered via software as a service (SaaS) rather than on-premises hardware or software.</p>

            <p><b>Improve disaster recovery:</b> With a secure cloud, you can easily back up and retrieve crucial data in the event of a calamity at your company. Because there is no need to physically connect to a network, remote workers can accomplish the same.
